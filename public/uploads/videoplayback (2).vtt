00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
Researchers have launched an open-source exoskeleton that could help people walk and train the robots of tomorrow.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.800
And it really do mean tomorrow.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.800
We are getting to the point where robotics is starting to operate in a very human-like way.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.000
That includes AI learning how humans move and then applying it to a non-linear framework.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.199
We will talk about it.

6
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.199
Now the AI suit is again fully open-source and many of the components can be assembled fairly easily and with a 3D printer.

7
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.399
It learns along with the user so that the AI actually gets better over time.

8
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.000
It learns to anticipate what the user would do.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.200
This could help people with movement disorders like ALS and MS.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.600
And it could help people who are paralyzed or even those that are recovering from paralysis, helping them get moving again.

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.799
When we stop using our neurons, our bodies do kind of just forget.

12
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.399
This is so important.

13
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.399
If you've ever just broken a limb and needed to get a soft cast,

14
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.200
you know that insurance doesn't cover it and you know exactly how expensive it is.

15
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.599
People who have lost limbs, for example, are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for something that is a little more than a hook.

16
00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:13.799
And 3D printing has made it possible to give people limbs at a relatively low cost.

17
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.799
You may ask, why do replacements cost quite so much?

18
00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.000
I don't have a good answer for you, but it's part of our insurance industry

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.599
and essentially companies charge as much as they can.

20
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.400
Then hopes that insurance will pay as much as they can get out of it.

21
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Unfortunately, people usually end up putting the bell.

22
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Yes, the answer is greed.

23
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.799
Now, these kinds of systems are really interesting because we have AI

24
00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.799
which contract a multitude of different signals and put it together and actually learn with the user.

25
00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.799
If you've ever broken your right hand repeatedly, like I have,

26
00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.400
you know that it takes a little while to get used to using your left hand,

27
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
even to do simple tasks like eating.

28
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.200
Ideally, this kind of system would use non-linear AI.

29
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.599
So neuromorphic AI and I've covered some of them in which they actually model the spiking patterns of a human brain.

30
00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:12.199
That type of AI is essentially plagiarizing our own neurology and it learns spatial movement a lot better.

31
00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:17.400
Standard linear AI and what we see for our large language models is just not good at operating a body.

32
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.199
Interestingly, the kind of feedback that could be collected from people using exosuits

33
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:27.400
could be used in actual robots helping them learn how to behave in a more human way.

34
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.599
Also, this was a robot designed to show human-like emotions and it gives me the creeps.

35
00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.800
Seriously, it's not comforting like at all.

36
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.199
If you follow the history of exosuits, well, they have been applied for people who have something like paralysis.

37
00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.800
They've also been applied for military.

38
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.599
Something that people can operate at a distance that can behave very much like a person, but remotely and that technology is coming to a Japanese company along with a Chinese company that's H2, which is a humanoid robot.

39
00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.000
They've collaborated and made a system that you can operate remotely.

40
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.800
They claim it's a lot like teleportation.

41
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.800
The robot learns the user's signals and that can be operated just with something like an EEG and the user gets hepatic feedback.

42
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.000
So they understand what's happening with the robot.

43
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.800
This technology has been being developed for quite some time, but it's still fairly nascent.

44
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:31.000
I do see a near future in which we actually fully map what's going on in our brains and can then reverse the flow so you can induce the feeling of what it would be like to operate a robot.

45
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I swear I saw a movie about that like many years ago.

46
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Does anyone know the name of that movie?

47
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:47.400
This technology could help people live full lives, but will probably be used for defense and video games, though we could have our real life sort art online.

48
00:03:47.400 --> 00:04:00.199
Ultimately, I think this is really cool, but I do not think it will be good for humanity that does also open up the door to what it would mean to be able to teach people things without having ever needed to do the hard work.

49
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:08.199
I think that would be both awesome and slightly terrifying because we'll get into the realm of could you reprogram a person probably.

50
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:17.399
Yeah. As we're starting to model human neurons and train them in a virtual world, the next steps are going to be human neurons in a head.

51
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:24.399
Now, one of the things that you find really interesting is that people become very attached even to defense robots, which don't have much of a personality.

52
00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:32.399
People have reported being distraught when a battlefield robot was destroyed, which honestly, I get I really do.

53
00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.399
Now, how do you feel about our relationship with robots? Because I'm kind of on the fence, but I really do like them.
